# Cycle_trips
Hello everyone , I have started this assignment about Cycle Trips to see permanent members and casual members.
I have continued this assignment with the help of Rstudio.
Here i have analysed the cycle trips through aggregating the data to be useful and accessible, 
and then organized the data to perform basic calculations. I have visualised the number of rides by rider type and also visualised the average duration needed which identifies the trends and relationships.
